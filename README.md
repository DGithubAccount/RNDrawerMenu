# Drawer navigation implementation in React Native

Common pattern in navigation is to use drawer from left (sometimes right) side for navigating between screens.


## npm Installations

```bash
 yarn add @react-navigation/drawer
```
```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```
```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

```bash
yarn add react-native-gesture-handler
```
```bash
yarn add react-native-screens
```
```bash
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
```
```bash
yarn add @react-native-community/masked-view
```
```bash
pod install
```


## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
